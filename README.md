# Unet for Segmenting Brain Tumors in MRI

U-Net is one of the semantic segmentation models initially used for medical image analysis. This Repo is the Pytorch Implementation written from scratch. Following are the main scripts:

1. unet_model.py - contains the model architecture
2. train_unet.py - script for training the model
3. test_unet.py - script for testing the model

The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
